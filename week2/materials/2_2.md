# Homework: Two-Pointer Technique in Arrays

List of 10 programs to practice the two-pointer technique. Implement each in C++.

1. **Problem:** Check if an array is a palindrome.  
   **Outcome:** Practice opposite ends pointers.  
   **Example:** Input: {1,2,2,1} Output: Yes

2. **Problem:** Find two numbers in a sorted array that sum to a target.  
   **Outcome:** Master pair sum with opposite ends.  
   **Example:** Input: {2,7,11,15}, target=9 Output: Indices [0,1]

3. **Problem:** Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.  
   **Outcome:** Learn same-direction pointers.  
   **Example:** Input: {1,1,2,2,3} Output: Length=3, Array=[1,2,3]

4. **Problem:** Move all zeros to the end of an array in-place.  
   **Outcome:** Practice partitioning with two pointers.  
   **Example:** Input: {0,1,0,3,12} Output: {1,3,12,0,0}

5. **Problem:** Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.  
   **Outcome:** Combine two-pointer logic across arrays.  
   **Example:** Input: {1,2,2,1}, {2,2} Output: {2,2}

6. **Problem:** Reverse an array using two pointers.  
   **Outcome:** In-place manipulation with opposite ends.  
   **Example:** Input: {1,2,3,4,5} Output: {5,4,3,2,1}

7. **Problem:** Find the longest subarray with sum less than or equal to k.  
   **Outcome:** Sliding window with two pointers.  
   **Example:** Input: {1,2,3,4}, k=5 Output: Length=2

8. **Problem:** Partition array around a pivot (e.g., move elements < pivot to left).  
   **Outcome:** Practice partitioning.  
   **Example:** Input: {3,1,4,1,5}, pivot=3 Output: {1,1,3,4,5}

9. **Problem:** Merge two sorted arrays into a new sorted array.  
   **Outcome:** Two-pointer merging.  
   **Example:** Input: {1,3,5}, {2,4,6} Output: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

10. **Problem:** Find if there exists a triplet summing to a target in a sorted array.  
    **Outcome:** Extend two-pointer to three-pointer logic.  
    **Example:** Input: {1,4,6,8,10}, target=12 Output: Yes (1,4,6)
