# C++ Refresher for DSA Cohort: Hour 7 - Homework

Practice these 15 problems to reinforce classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and access mechanisms. They increase in complexity to build skills for coding interviews.

1. **Problem**: Create a class `Rectangle` with length and width, and a method to compute area.  
   **Outcome**: Print area.  
   **Example**: Length 4, Width 5 → 20

2. **Problem**: Write a class `Circle` with a private radius and public method to compute circumference.  
   **Outcome**: Print circumference.  
   **Example**: Radius 3 → 18.8496

3. **Problem**: Create a class `Counter` with a private count and methods to increment and get count.  
   **Outcome**: Print count after increments.  
   **Example**: Increment twice → 2

4. **Problem**: Write a class `Student` with a constructor to initialize name and ID.  
   **Outcome**: Print student details.  
   **Example**: "Alice", 101 → Alice, 101

5. **Problem**: Create a class `DynamicArray` with a dynamic array and destructor to free memory.  
   **Outcome**: Print array elements.  
   **Example**: [1, 2, 3] → 1 2 3

6. **Problem**: Write a class `Point` with private x, y coordinates and a method to compute distance from another point.  
   **Outcome**: Print distance.  
   **Example**: (1, 1), (4, 5) → 5

7. **Problem**: Create a class `Bank` with private balance and methods for deposit and withdrawal.  
   **Outcome**: Print balance after transactions.  
   **Example**: Deposit 100, Withdraw 50 → 50

8. **Problem**: Write a class `Car` with a constructor and destructor to manage a dynamic license plate.  
   **Outcome**: Print creation and destruction messages.  
   **Example**: "ABC123" → Created, Destroyed

9. **Problem**: Create a class `Box` with private dimensions and a public method to compute volume.  
   **Outcome**: Print volume.  
   **Example**: 2, 3, 4 → 24

10. **Problem**: Write a class `Employee` with private salary and public methods to set and get salary.  
    **Outcome**: Print salary after setting.  
    **Example**: Set 5000 → 5000

11. **Problem**: Create a class `String` with a private `std::string` and method to reverse it.  
    **Outcome**: Print reversed string.  
    **Example**: "hello" → "olleh"

12. **Problem**: Write a class `Inventory` with a dynamic array of items and destructor to free memory.  
    **Outcome**: Print items.  
    **Example**: ["pen", "book"] → pen, book

13. **Problem**: Create a class `Complex` for complex numbers with methods for addition.  
    **Outcome**: Print sum of two complex numbers.  
    **Example**: (1, 2), (3, 4) → (4, 6)

14. **Problem**: Write a class `Queue` with private array and methods to enqueue and dequeue.  
    **Outcome**: Print queue after operations.  
    **Example**: Enqueue 1, 2; Dequeue → 2

15. **Problem**: Create a class `Matrix` with a dynamic 2D array and method to compute determinant (2x2).  
    **Outcome**: Print determinant.  
    **Example**: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] → -2
