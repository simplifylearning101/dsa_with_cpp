### Week 0: Theme - [Revising C++ Fundamentals]

Outcome Expected: Students refresh core C++ concepts from college, writing basic programs confidently, understanding pointers, references, and basic OOP principles, preparing for STL and DSA. 

By the end of the week, you will be comfortable writing some advanced C++ programs, manipulating arrays, woking with pointers, using classes and objects. You'll start thinking about time/space complexity basics and introduced to Big-O operations confidently.

For convinience, we have split this into 5 parts - each expected to take an hour approx.

- First hour
