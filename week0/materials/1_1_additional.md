# Primitive Data Types in C++
Below is a clear and concise table summarizing the **primitive data types** in C++, their **significance**, **variants**, and the **data they can hold**.

## Table of Primitive Data Types in C++

| **Data Type** | **Significance** | **Variants** | **Data It Can Hold** | **Typical Size (Bytes)** |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **int**       | Represents whole numbers, used for general-purpose integer arithmetic (e.g., counters, indices). | `short`, `int`, `long`, `long long` | Integer values (e.g., -5, 0, 42). Range depends on variant (e.g., `int` typically -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit systems). | `short`: 2<br>`int`: 4<br>`long`: 4 or 8<br>`long long`: 8 |
| **float**     | Represents single-precision floating-point numbers, used for approximate real numbers (e.g., scientific calculations). | `float` | Decimal numbers with moderate precision (e.g., 3.14, -0.001). Approx. 7 decimal digits. | 4 |
| **double**    | Represents double-precision floating-point numbers, used for higher precision in calculations (e.g., financial or scientific data). | `double`, `long double` | Decimal numbers with higher precision (e.g., 3.14159265359). `double`: ~15 decimal digits; `long double`: varies (often 10-12 bytes). | `double`: 8<br>`long double`: 10-16 |
| **char**      | Represents single characters or small integers, used for text processing or ASCII/Unicode storage. | `char`, `signed char`, `unsigned char` | Single characters (e.g., 'A', '@') or small integers (0 to 255 for `unsigned char`, -128 to 127 for `signed char`). | 1 |
| **bool**      | Represents logical values, used for conditional logic (e.g., loops, if-statements). | None | `true` or `false`. | 1 |
| **void**      | Indicates no value or type, used for functions that return nothing or generic pointers. | None | No data (used in function signatures like `void func()` or pointers like `void*`). | N/A |

## Notes on the Table

- **Sizes**: The size of data types (e.g., `int`, `long`) can vary depending on the system (32-bit vs. 64-bit) and compiler. The table lists typical sizes for modern systems (e.g., using GCC/Clang on 64-bit platforms). Use `sizeof(type)` in C++ to check the size on your system.
- **Variants**:
  - For integers (`int`): `short`, `long`, and `long long` modify the range and size. You can also add `signed` (default) or `unsigned` to allow only non-negative values (e.g., `unsigned int` holds 0 to 4,294,967,295).
  - For `char`: `signed char` and `unsigned char` explicitly define the sign, while plain `char` may be signed or unsigned depending on the compiler.
  - For `double`: `long double` offers extended precision but is platform-dependent.
- **Significance**: Each type is optimized for specific use cases. For example, use `int` for loop counters, `double` for precise calculations, `char` for text, and `bool` for flags.
- **Data Range**: The range depends on the size. For example, a 4-byte `int` has a range of approximately Â±2 billion. Use `<limits>` (e.g., `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`) to check exact ranges programmatically.
- **void**: Not a data-holding type but included as a primitive type for completeness, often used in function declarations or pointers.
