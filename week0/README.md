### Week 0: Theme - [Revising C++ Fundamentals]

You will quickly refresh your core C++ concepts, write some basic programs confidently, understand pointers, references, and basic OOP principles, get ready for STL and DSA. 

By the end of the week, you will be comfortable writing some advanced C++ programs, manipulating arrays, woking with pointers, using classes and objects. You'll start thinking about time / space complexity.

For convinience, we have split this week into multiple parts - each part is expected to take an hour approx. For each part, you will read the course material provided here, attempt few programs on the go. Complete the homework and then attempt the quiz. 

After all parts are over, attempt the interview questions. 

All programs are discussed in detail in the classroom training.

| Part | Read | Practice | Attempt |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |[Variables / Data types / Operators](materials/1_1.md)|[home work](materials/1_2.md) -> [solutions](materials/1_3.md)|[quiz](materials/1_4.md)|
| 2 |[Decision making / Loops](materials/2_1.md)|[home work](materials/2_2.md) -> [solutions](materials/2_3.md)|[quiz](materials/2_4.md)|
| 3 |[Functions / Arrays](materials/3_1.md)|[home work](materials/3_2.md) -> [solutions](materials/3_3.md)|[quiz](materials/3_4.md)|
| 4 |[Pointers / References / Strings](materials/4_1.md)|[home work](materials/4_2.md) -> [solutions](materials/4_3.md)|[quiz](materials/4_4.md)|

| 7 |[Object oriented programming](materials/7_1.md)|[home work](materials/7_2.md) -> [solutions](materials/7_3.md)|[quiz](materials/7_4.md)|
| 8 |[Inheritance / Polymorphism / Function overaloading / Operator Overaloding](materials/8_1.md)|[home work](materials/8_2.md) -> [solutions](materials/8_3.md)|[quiz](materials/8_4.md)|


### Interview Prep time
| [Easy](materials/9_1.md) | [Little hard](materials/9_2.md) | [Hard](materials/9_3.md) | [Very hard](materials/9_4.md) |
|---|---|---|---|

### Project Time
| [Project Requirement](materials/10_1.md) | [Solution](materials/10_2.md) |
|---|---|

### End
Congratulations. You have done a lot of things. Lets move to STL journey from next week
