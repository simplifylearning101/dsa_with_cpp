1. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/  
   **Problem:** Given a 1-indexed sorted array, find two numbers summing to target. Return indices.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Master pair sum with two pointers.  
   **Example:** Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [1,2]  
   **Example:** Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6 Output: [1,3]
