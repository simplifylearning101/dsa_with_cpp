# Hour 1 Quiz: C++ STL and Vectors

Below are 30 questions to test understanding of STL vectors and basic C++ concepts. Since this is the first hour, questions focus on vectors and foundational C++ knowledge relevant to interviews. Each question includes the correct answer and explanation.

## Quiz Questions

1. **What does STL stand for in C++?**  
   a) Standard Template Library  
   b) Simple Template Library  
   c) Structured Type Library  
   d) System Template Library  
   **Answer**: a) Standard Template Library  
   **Explanation**: STL is a library of template classes for containers, algorithms, iterators, and functors.

2. **Which header is required to use vectors in C++?**  
   a) `<array>`  
   b) `<vector>`  
   c) `<list>`  
   d) `<map>`  
   **Answer**: b) `<vector>`  
   **Explanation**: The `<vector>` header provides the vector container class.

3. **What is the time complexity of `push_back` in a vector?**  
   a) O(1)  
   b) O(n)  
   c) O(log n)  
   d) O(1) amortized  
   **Answer**: d) O(1) amortized  
   **Explanation**: `push_back` is O(1) on average, but may trigger reallocation (O(n)) occasionally.

4. **How do you declare an empty vector of integers?**  
   a) `vector<int> v;`  
   b) `int vector v;`  
   c) `vector v<int>;`  
   d) `vector<int> v();`  
   **Answer**: a) `vector<int> v;`  
   **Explanation**: Correct syntax for an empty vector of integers.

5. **What does `vector<int> v(5, 10);` create?**  
   a) Empty vector with capacity 5  
   b) Vector with 5 elements, each set to 10  
   c) Vector with 10 elements, each set to 5  
   d) Vector with 5 elements, uninitialized  
   **Answer**: b) Vector with 5 elements, each set to 10  
   **Explanation**: The constructor `vector(size, value)` initializes `size` elements with `value`.

6. **Which method accesses the first element of a vector?**  
   a) `back()`  
   b) `front()`  
   c) `begin()`  
   d) `at(0)`  
   **Answer**: b) `front()`  
   **Explanation**: `front()` returns the first element; `at(0)` also works but is less specific.

7. **What happens if you access a vector with `v.at(10)` when size is 5?**  
   a) Returns 0  
   b) Undefined behavior  
   c) Throws out_of_range exception  
   d) Returns garbage value  
   **Answer**: c) Throws out_of_range exception  
   **Explanation**: `at()` performs bounds checking and throws an exception if out of range.

8. **What is the difference between `size()` and `capacity()`?**  
   a) `size()` is allocated memory, `capacity()` is number of elements  
   b) `size()` is number of elements, `capacity()` is allocated memory  
   c) Both are the same  
   d) `size()` is for vectors, `capacity()` is for arrays  
   **Answer**: b) `size()` is number of elements, `capacity()` is allocated memory  
   **Explanation**: `size()` is current elements, `capacity()` is memory reserved.

9. **What does `pop_back()` do?**  
   a) Removes first element  
   b) Removes last element  
   c) Clears the vector  
   d) Reduces capacity  
   **Answer**: b) Removes last element  
   **Explanation**: `pop_back()` removes the last element in O(1) time.

10. **What does `reserve(n)` do to a vector?**  
    a) Sets size to n  
    b) Pre-allocates memory for n elements  
    c) Clears n elements  
    d) Resizes vector to n elements  
    **Answer**: b) Pre-allocates memory for n elements  
    **Explanation**: `reserve(n)` ensures capacity ≥ n to avoid reallocations.

11. **What is the output of `vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3}; cout << v.size();`?**  
    a) 3  
    b) 2  
    c) 0  
    d) Undefined  
    **Answer**: a) 3

12. **Which iterator points to one past the last element of a vector?**  
    a) `begin()`  
    b) `end()`  
    c) `rbegin()`  
    d) `rend()`  
    **Answer**: b) `end()`

    a) Use `begin()` to `end()`  
    b) Use `rbegin()` to `rend()`  
    c) Use `end()` to `begin()`  
    d) Use `front()` to `back()`  
    **Answer**: b) Use `rbegin()` to `rend()`  
    **Explanation**: `rbegin()` and `rend()` are for reverse iteration.

14. **What is the time complexity of accessing an element with `v[i]`?**  
    a) O(1)  
    b) O(n)  
    c) O(log n)  
    d) O(n^2)  
    **Answer**: a) O(1)  
    **Explanation**: Vectors are contiguous, so indexing is O(1).

15. **What is the purpose of `using namespace std;`?**  
    a) Imports all STL containers  
    b) Avoids writing `std::` for standard library components  
    c) Defines vector class  
    d) Enables iterator support  
    **Answer**: b) Avoids writing `std::` for standard library components  
    **Explanation**: It brings `std` namespace into scope, but use cautiously in large programs.

16. **What happens if you dereference `v.end()`?**  
    a) Returns last element  
    b) Undefined behavior  
    c) Returns 0  
    d) Throws exception  
    **Answer**: b) Undefined behavior  
    **Explanation**: `end()` points past the last element and cannot be dereferenced.

17. **How do you initialize a vector with 5 zeros?**  
    a) `vector<int> v(5);`  
    b) `vector<int> v(5, 0);`  
    c) `vector<int> v = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};`  
    d) Both b and c  
    **Answer**: d) Both b and c  
    **Explanation**: Both methods initialize a vector with 5 zeros.

18. **What does `vector<int>().swap(v);` do?**  
    a) Copies vector  
    b) Clears vector and frees memory  
    c) Resizes vector  
    d) Swaps two vectors  
    **Answer**: b) Clears vector and frees memory  
    **Explanation**: This is a "shrink-to-fit" idiom to clear and reduce capacity.

19. **Which is safer for accessing vector elements?**  
    a) `v[i]`  
    b) `v.at(i)`  
    c) Both are equally safe  
    d) Neither is safe  
    **Answer**: b) `v.at(i)`  
    **Explanation**: `at(i)` checks bounds and throws an exception if out of range.

20. **What is the output of `vector<int> v; v.push_back(1); cout << v.capacity();`?**  
    a) 1  
    b) 0  
    c) Implementation-dependent  
    d) Undefined  
    **Answer**: c) Implementation-dependent  
    **Explanation**: Capacity after `push_back` depends on the STL implementation.

21. **Can a vector store strings?**  
    a) Yes  
    b) No  
    c) Only integers  
    d) Only with custom classes  
    **Answer**: a) Yes  
    **Explanation**: Vectors are templates and can store any type, including strings.

22. **What does `resize(n)` do if n is smaller than the current size?**  
    a) Adds n elements  
    b) Removes elements from the end  
    c) Throws an exception  
    d) Clears the vector  
    **Answer**: b) Removes elements from the end  
    **Explanation**: `resize(n)` reduces size to n, removing extra elements.

23. **Which loop is modern for iterating over a vector?**  
    a) `for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)`  
    b) `for (vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)`  
    c) `for (int x : v)`  
    d) All of the above  
    **Answer**: c) `for (int x : v)`  
    **Explanation**: Range-based for loop is modern and readable (C++11+).

24. **What is a vector’s underlying data structure?**  
    a) Linked list  
    b) Dynamic array  
    c) Binary tree  
    d) Hash table  
    **Answer**: b) Dynamic array  
    **Explanation**: Vectors use contiguous memory like arrays but can resize.

25. **What happens to iterators after `push_back` if capacity changes?**  
    a) Remain valid  
    b) Become invalid  
    c) Point to new elements  
    d) Cause compilation error  
    **Answer**: b) Become invalid  
    **Explanation**: Reallocation invalidates all iterators due to memory relocation.

26. **How do you check if a vector is empty?**  
    a) `v.size() == 0`  
    b) `v.empty()`  
    c) Both a and b  
    d) `v.begin() == v.end()`  
    **Answer**: c) Both a and b  
    **Explanation**: Both methods work, but `empty()` is preferred for clarity.

27. **What is the output of `vector<int> v = {1, 2}; v.resize(4, 3); cout << v[3];`?**  
    a) 1  
    b) 2  
    c) 3  
    d) Undefined  
    **Answer**: c) 3  
    **Explanation**: `resize(4, 3)` adds two elements with value 3.

28. **Which operation is NOT O(1) for vectors?**  
    a) `push_back`  
    b) `pop_back`  
    c) `insert` (at beginning)  
    d) `front`  
    **Answer**: c) `insert` (at beginning)  
    **Explanation**: Inserting at the beginning is O(n) due to shifting elements.

29. **What does `#include <vector>` do?**  
    a) Includes all STL containers  
    b) Provides vector class  
    c) Enables algorithms  
    d) Defines iterators

    b) Prevents reallocations  
    c) Clears vector  
    d) Reduces memory usage  
    **Answer**: b) Prevents reallocations  
    **Explanation**: `reserve` pre-allocates memory to avoid costly reallocations.
