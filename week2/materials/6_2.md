# Homework: Two-Pointer and Sliding Window for Strings

List of 10 programs to practice two-pointer and sliding window techniques on strings. Implement each in C++.

1. **Problem:** Find the longest substring with at most k distinct characters.  
   **Outcome:** Master variable sliding window.  
   **Example:** Input: "eceba", k=2 Output: 3

2. **Problem:** Check if a string contains another string as a substring.  
   **Outcome:** Practice substring search.  
   **Example:** Input: "hello", "ll" Output: 2

3. **Problem:** Find all anagrams in a string.  
   **Outcome:** Sliding window with frequency counting.  
   **Example:** Input: s="cbaebabacd", p="abc" Output: [0,6]

4. **Problem:** Reverse words in a string (in-place).  
   **Outcome:** Two-pointer word reversal.  
   **Example:** Input: "hello world" Output: "olleh dlrow"

5. **Problem:** Find the minimum window substring containing all characters of another string.  
   **Outcome:** Variable sliding window optimization.  
   **Example:** Input: s="ADOBECODEBANC", t="ABC" Output: "BANC"

6. **Problem:** Check if a string is a valid palindrome ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.  
   **Outcome:** Two-pointer with preprocessing.  
   **Example:** Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" Output: Yes

7. **Problem:** Find the longest repeating character replacement substring.  
   **Outcome:** Sliding window with character replacement.  
   **Example:** Input: s="ABAB", k=2 Output: 4

8. **Problem:** Group anagrams from an array of strings.  
   **Outcome:** Frequency counting with hash map.  
   **Example:** Input: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"] Output: [["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]

9. **Problem:** Check if a string can be formed by repeating a substring.  
   **Outcome:** String pattern matching.  
   **Example:** Input: "abab" Output: Yes

10. **Problem:** Find the longest substring without repeating characters.  
    **Outcome:** Sliding window with unique characters.  
    **Example:** Input: "abcabcbb" Output: 3
