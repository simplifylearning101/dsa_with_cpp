## Arrays and Two-Pointer Techniques 
This week focuses on mastering array manipulations and the two-pointer technique to solve problems efficiently, with an emphasis on achieving O(n) time complexity where possible. Students will learn to work with arrays (both static and dynamic via vector) and apply two-pointer strategies for problems like finding pairs or checking palindromes. The real-world analogy is that arrays are like fixed-size parking lots, and two-pointer techniques are like two friends searching a line of items from both ends.
Outcome Expected: By the end of Week 2, students will be proficient in manipulating arrays, implementing two-pointer algorithms, and solving related LeetCode problems (e.g., #1 Two Sum, #26 Remove Duplicates). They will also complete a project, such as an "Inventory System," using vector for item management with search and sort functionality.
Topics Covered:

Arrays: Traversal, rotation, insertion/deletion, and common operations. (Analogy: A fixed-size parking lot where each slot holds an item.)
Two-Pointer Technique: Solving problems like finding pairs with a given sum or checking if an array is a palindrome. (Analogy: Two friends scanning a line from opposite ends.)

Homework: Lots of programs (e.g., reverse array, remove duplicates, rotate array). Solve LeetCode array problems.

Project: "Inventory System" – Use vector to manage items (e.g., name, quantity), implementing add, search, and sort functions in a console app.
This builds on Week 0 (C++ fundamentals) and Week 1 (STL mastery), preparing students for more complex data structures like linked lists in Week 3.
