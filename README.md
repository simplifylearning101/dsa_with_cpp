# 10-Week DSA Cohort Roadmap in C++

Welcome to the 10-Week DSA Mastery Cohort! This will build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. At the end of the course, you should be 10x confident on your skills for coding interviews. 

### Overview of this program:

- Goal: Master DSA in C++ for coding interviews.
- Approach: Start with C++ revision (Week 0), master STL (Week 1), then build DSA expertise (Weeks 2–9), and integrate skills with mock interviews (Week 10).
- Methodology: Concepts explained with real-world analogies, fully commented C++ code, daily homework (10–15 programs), LeetCode/NeetCode practice, and weekly projects.
- Tools: C++11/14, LeetCode (tag by topic), NeetCode (curated roadmaps). Track progress in a problem-solving journal.

### Approach
- This is a cohort based model of learning. You will join the cohort and learn with others. 
- There would be online sessions 2-3 times (of 1-1.5 hrs) per week discussing conceptual explanations with real-world examples and C++ programs.
- You will then practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed on daily basis. 
- You will slowly start practicing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.
- Weekly fun project: At the end of the week, you will develop a mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). 
- You will form a group, work on project and present it to rest of the cohort members.

## Before we start
1. Do you have a local environement run Cpp programs? If not, reachout to tech coodinator for help (details below)  
2. Are you familiar with git and github? If not, reachout to tech coodinator for help.
3. Create a github repo so that you can showcase your work, dedication and commitment. 

## Coordinators
Once you join the cohort, you will be invited to cohort WhatsApp group where you can seek help from our coordinators
