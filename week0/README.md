### Week 0: Theme - [Revising C++ Fundamentals]

You will quickly refresh your core C++ concepts, write some basic programs confidently, understand pointers, references, and basic OOP principles, get ready for STL and DSA. 

By the end of the week, you will be comfortable writing some advanced C++ programs, manipulating arrays, woking with pointers, using classes and objects. You'll start thinking about time / space complexity.

For convinience, we have split this week into multiple parts - each part is expected to take an hour approx. For each part, you will read the course material provided here, attempt few programs on the go. Complete the homework and then attempt the quiz. 

After all parts are over, attempt the interview questions.

### Project Time
Form a group of 3-4 people. Choose one [project from the list](https://github.com/simplifylearning101/dsa_with_cpp/blob/main/week0/projects/README.md) and implement it. You should be able to walk thru the code. 

You will find the solution in the solutions folder inside. DO NOT use it. Refer it only if you are stuck. 

### End
Congratulations. You have done a lot of things. Lets move to STL journey from next week
[Go back to main course](https://github.com/simplifylearning101/dsa_with_cpp/blob/main/README.md)
