# Hour 5 Homework: Queue Practice Problems

Below are 12 practice problems to reinforce understanding of C++ STL `queue`. Each problem includes a description, expected outcome, and example to guide students. These problems range from basic to moderately complex to build confidence for coding interviews.

1. **Problem**: Create a queue, push 5 integers, and print its size.  
   **Outcome**: Understand queue initialization and `size()`.  
   **Example**: Push 1,2,3,4,5 → Output: Size: 5  

2. **Problem**: Pop elements from a queue and print them in order.  
   **Outcome**: Practice `pop` and `front` for FIFO behavior.  
   **Example**: Queue: [1,2,3] → Output: 1 2 3  

3. **Problem**: Check if a queue is empty after pushing and popping elements.  
   **Outcome**: Master `empty()` usage.  
   **Example**: Push 1, pop 1 → Output: Empty: Yes  

4. **Problem**: Implement a function to reverse a queue using a stack.  
   **Outcome**: Learn queue and stack integration.  
   **Example**: Queue: [1,2,3] → Output: [3,2,1]  

5. **Problem**: Simulate a ticket counter serving customers in order.  
   **Outcome**: Apply queue for FIFO processing.  
   **Example**: Customers: ["Alice", "Bob"] → Output: Served: Alice, Served: Bob  

6. **Problem**: Implement a queue using two stacks.  
   **Outcome**: Understand queue implementation.  
   **Example**: Push 1,2,3, pop → Output: 1  

7. **Problem**: Find the first non-repeating character in a stream using a queue.  
   **Outcome**: Combine queue with frequency tracking.  
   **Example**: Stream: "aabbc" → Output: a a b b c  

8. **Problem**: Calculate the average of the last k elements in a stream.  
   **Outcome**: Practice sliding window with queue.  
   **Example**: Stream: [1,2,3], k=2 → Output: 2.5  

9. **Problem**: Implement a circular queue with fixed size.  
   **Outcome**: Learn circular queue concepts.  
   **Example**: Size=3, push(1,2,3) → Full: Yes  

10. **Problem**: Merge two queues alternately.  
    **Outcome**: Practice queue manipulation.  
    **Example**: Queue1: [1,3], Queue2: [2,4] → Output: [1,2,3,4]  

11. **Problem**: Simulate a printer queue with priority.  
    **Outcome**: Apply queue with priority logic.  
    **Example**: Jobs: [(1,low), (2,high), (3,low)] → Output: 2 1 3  

12. **Problem**: Find the time to process all tasks in a queue with cooldown.  
    **Outcome**: Apply queue for scheduling with constraints.  
    **Example**: Tasks: [1,1,2], cooldown=2 → Output: 7
