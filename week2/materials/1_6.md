1. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/  
   **Problem:** Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Learn to check for duplicates efficiently.  
   **Example:** Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: true  
   **Example:** Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] Output: false

2. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/  
   **Problem:** You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Understand min-max tracking in arrays.  
   **Example:** Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 (buy 1, sell 6)  
   **Example:** Input: [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0

3. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/  
   **Problem:** Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Intro to subarray problems.  
   **Example:** Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] Output: 6 ([4,-1,2,1])  
   **Example:** Input: [1] Output: 1

4. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/  
   **Problem:** Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.  
   **Outcome Expected:** In-place array manipulation.  
   **Example:** Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  
   **Example:** Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2 Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

5. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/  
   **Problem:** Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. Return the number of unique elements.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Basic duplicate handling.  
   **Example:** Input: [1,1,2] Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]  
   **Example:** Input: [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_]

6. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/  
   **Problem:** Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Element shifting.  
   **Example:** Input: [0,1,0,3,12] Output: [1,3,12,0,0]  
   **Example:** Input: [0] Output: [0]

7. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/  
   **Problem:** Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element (appears more than n/2 times).  
   **Outcome Expected:** Frequency counting.  
   **Example:** Input: [3,2,3] Output: 3  
   **Example:** Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2] Output: 2

8. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/  
   **Problem:** You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.  
   **Outcome Expected:** Handle carry in arrays.  
   **Example:** Input: [1,2,3] Output: [1,2,4]  
   **Example:** Input: [9,9,9] Output: [1,0,0,0]

9. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/  
   **Problem:** Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.  
   **Outcome Expected:** XOR trick for uniqueness.  
   **Example:** Input: [2,2,1] Output: 1  
   **Example:** Input: [4,1,2,1,2] Output: 4

10. **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/  
    **Problem:** Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.  
    **Outcome Expected:** Array comparison.  
    **Example:** Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2] Output: [2,2]  
    **Example:** Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4] Output: [4,9]
