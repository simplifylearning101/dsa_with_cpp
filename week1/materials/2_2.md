# Hour 2 Homework: Array and Deque Practice Problems

Below are 12 practice problems to reinforce understanding of C++ STL arrays and deques. Each problem includes a description, expected outcome, and example to guide students. These problems range from basic to moderately complex to build confidence for coding interviews.

1. **Problem**: Create an STL array of 5 integers, initialize it with user input, and print in reverse order.  
   **Outcome**: Understand array initialization and reverse iteration.  
   **Example**: Input: 1 2 3 4 5 → Output: 5 4 3 2 1  

2. **Problem**: Implement a stack using a deque (push and pop from back).  
   **Outcome**: Practice deque as a stack.  
   **Example**: Push 1, 2, 3; Pop → Output: 3, Stack: [1, 2]  

3. **Problem**: Create a deque, add 3 elements to front and 3 to back, print size and elements.  
   **Outcome**: Master `push_front` and `push_back`.  
   **Example**: Input: Front: [3, 2, 1], Back: [4, 5, 6] → Output: Size: 6, Elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

4. **Problem**: Use an STL array to store 4 strings and swap the first and last elements.  
   **Outcome**: Learn array element manipulation.  
   **Example**: Input: ["cat", "dog", "bird", "fish"] → Output: ["fish", "dog", "bird", "cat"]  

5. **Problem**: Check if a deque is empty. If not, print its first and last elements.  
   **Outcome**: Understand `empty`, `front`, and `back`.  
   **Example**: Input: [10, 20, 30] → Output: First: 10, Last: 30  

6. **Problem**: Convert a vector to a deque and print elements in reverse.  
   **Outcome**: Practice container conversion and reverse iteration.  
   **Example**: Input: Vector [1, 2, 3] → Output: Deque [3, 2, 1]  

7. **Problem**: Implement a queue using a deque (push to back, pop from front).  
   **Outcome**: Practice deque as a queue.  
   **Example**: Push 1, 2, 3; Pop → Output: 1, Queue: [2, 3]  

8. **Problem**: Create an STL array of 6 integers, find the sum using iterators.  
   **Outcome**: Practice iterator-based traversal.  
   **Example**: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → Output: Sum: 21  

9. **Problem**: Remove the first and last elements from a deque and print the updated deque.  
   **Outcome**: Master `pop_front` and `pop_back`.  
   **Example**: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: [2, 3]  

10. **Problem**: Create a deque of doubles, double each element using iterators.  
    **Outcome**: Learn to modify deque elements.  
    **Example**: Input: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5] → Output: [3.0, 5.0, 7.0]  

11. **Problem**: Use an STL array to simulate a fixed-size circular buffer (overwrite oldest element).  
    **Outcome**: Understand array’s fixed-size nature.  
    **Example**: Buffer size 3, Push 1, 2, 3, 4 → Output: [2, 3, 4]  

12. **Problem**: Merge two deques into a single deque, preserving order.  
    **Outcome**: Practice deque concatenation.  
    **Example**: Input: Deque1 [1, 2], Deque2 [3, 4] → Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
