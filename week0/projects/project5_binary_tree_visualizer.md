# C++ Project Idea: Binary Tree Visualizer

**Project Title**: Binary Tree Visualizer  
**Description**: Develop a console-based application to create and visualize a binary tree, like a family tree diagram. This project focuses on recursion, polymorphism, and dynamic memory for tree operations, preparing students for DSA tree-based problems.

**Requirements**:
- Create an abstract base class `TreeNode` with a pure virtual method for traversal (e.g., inorder).
- Derive a `BinaryNode` class with attributes (value, left/right child pointers) and implement traversal methods.
- Use constructors to initialize nodes and destructors to free child pointers.
- Overload the `+` operator to merge two trees (e.g., add a subtree).
- Implement recursive functions for traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).
- Use function overloading to insert nodes (e.g., single value vs. array of values).
- Store the tree using dynamic memory and pointers for node connections.
- Provide a menu-driven interface using control structures (insert, traverse, merge trees).
- Use operator overloading to compare trees by structure or values.
- Use I/O to display tree traversals in a readable format (e.g., space-separated values).

**Expected Outcome**:  
A console application where users can:  
- Insert nodes (e.g., values 5, 3, 7 → tree created).  
- Perform traversals (e.g., inorder → 3 5 7).  
- Merge trees (e.g., tree1 + tree2 → combined tree).  
- Compare trees (e.g., tree1 == tree2 → equal or not).  
The program ensures proper memory management and clear console output for traversals.
