# C++ Refresher - First hour

This is a 1-hour refresher session designed to revise your foundational C++ concepts so you are ready for this 10-week Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course.

## Topics Covered
We will revise the following concepts:  
1. Variables and Data Types  
2. Input/Output Operations  
3. Operators  
4. Basic Program Structure  

### Concept 1: Variables and Data Types
Variables are like containers in a kitchen where you store ingredients — each has a name and holds a specific type of item.

In C++, variables store data, and **data types** define what kind of data they can hold (e.g `int` for whole numbers, `double` for decimals, `char` for single characters, `bool` for true/false, etc.). 

Declaring a variable tells the compiler to reserve space in memory. Always initialize variables to avoid unexpected values.

**Example Program: Basic Variable Declaration and Usage**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    double height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';
    bool isStudent = true;
    
    // Output the values to the console
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Initial: " << initial << endl;
    cout << "Is Student: " << (isStudent ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
```
Age: 25
Height: 5.9
Initial: A
Is Student: Yes
```

### Concept 2: Input/Output Operations
- In C++, we use `std::cin` for input from the keyboard and `std::cout` for output to the screen. 
- Always include `<iostream>` and use `std::` namespace or `using namespace std;` for simplicity. 
- Handle inputs carefully to avoid errors, like reading extra spaces.

**Example Program: Simple Input and Output**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int quantity;  
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    
    cout << "Enter quantity of apples: ";
    cin >> quantity;
    
    // Output the results
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You want " << quantity << " apples." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**
Enter your name: Alice
Enter quantity of apples: 5
Hello, Alice! You want 5 apples.

### Concept 3: Operators
Operators are like math tools in a calculator: 
- arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for remainder) 
- relational (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for comparisons)
- logical (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT) 
- and assignment (`=`) 

Be careful 
- with division (integer division truncates decimals) 
- and operator precedence (use parentheses for clarity).

**Example Program: Using Operators for a Simple Calculator**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;
    
    int sum = a + b;
    int diff = a - b;
    int prod = a * b;
    int quot = a / b;
    int rem = a % b;  // Modulus: remainder (1)
    
    bool isGreaterAndSumBig = (a > b) && (sum > 10);
    
    // Output results
    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference: " << diff << endl;
    cout << "Product: " << prod << endl;
    cout << "Quotient: " << quot << endl;
    cout << "Remainder: " << rem << endl;
    cout << "Is a > b and sum > 10? " << (isGreaterAndSumBig ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
Is a > b and sum > 10? Yes
```
This mimics calculating a restaurant bill with checks.

### Concept 4: Basic Program Structure
Every C++ program is like a story: it has a beginning (`#include` directives and `main()`), middle (code body), and end (`return 0;`). 

Use comments (`//` or `/* */`) for notes, like labels on kitchen shelves. Compile with `g++` and run the executable. Common errors: missing semicolons or unmatched braces.

**Example Program: Hello World with Structure**
```cpp
// This is a single-line comment: Program to greet the world

/* This is a multi-line comment:
   Author: Your Teacher
   Purpose: Demonstrate basic structure */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
```
Hello, World!
```
This is the "first recipe" every programmer learns.

### Points to Remember for Interview Preparation
- Understand data type sizes (e.g., `int` is usually 4 bytes) and ranges to avoid overflow in interviews (e.g., use `long long` for large numbers).  
- Know the difference between signed and unsigned types for edge cases in problems.  
- Master operator precedence and associativity—interviews often test tricky expressions like `a + b * c`.  
- Use `std::endl` vs `\n` for output: `endl` flushes the buffer, which can be slower in performance-critical code.  
- Always handle input validation; `cin` can fail — use `cin.fail()` in robust code for interviews.  
- Remember `#include` guards and namespaces to avoid conflicts in larger programs.  
- In interviews, explain why you choose a data type (e.g., `float` vs `double` for precision).  
- Practice writing clean, commented code—interviewers value readability.  
- Know common pitfalls: uninitialized variables lead to undefined behavior.
