# Project Agenda: Inventory Management System

## Outcome Expected:
By completing this project, students will apply array and string algorithms (from Weeks 2 and 3) to build an inventory management system. Students will demonstrate mastery of array manipulation, string searching (KMP), grouping (frequency counting), and compression, while handling file I/O and edge cases.

## Project Tasks
1. **Item Addition**: Use arrays to store item names (strings) and quantities.  
2. **Item Search**: Use KMP or naive search to find items by name.  
3. **Group Items by Category**: Use frequency counting or sorting to group items by category (strings).  
4. **Compress Inventory List**: Compress repeated items using string compression technique.  
5. **File I/O**: Read inventory from a file and write updated inventory.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Item Addition
- Use a vector of pairs (string name, int quantity) for inventory.

**Logic**:
- Push new items to the array.
- Handle duplicates by updating quantity.

### 2. Item Search
- Search for an item name using KMP (O(n+m)).

**Logic**:
- Compute LPS array for the pattern (item name).
- Traverse the concatenated inventory names to find matches.

### 3. Group Items by Category
- Assume categories are string prefixes or anagrams; group using frequency.

**Logic**:
- Use hash map with frequency key to group items.

### 4. Compress Inventory List
- Compress the string representation of inventory (e.g., "apple3banana2" for multiple items).

**Logic**:
- Count consecutive similar items and write compressed string.

### 5. File I/O
- Read items from `inventory.txt` (name,quantity).
- Write updated inventory after operations.

## Points to Remember
- **Edge Cases**: Empty inventory, duplicate items, invalid quantities.
- **Complexity**: O(n+m) for search, O(n*k) for grouping.
- **Interview Tips**: Explain optimizations (e.g., KMP vs. naive search).
- Use `std::vector` for arrays, `std::string` for names.
