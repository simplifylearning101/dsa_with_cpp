# C++ Refresher - First hour

This is a 1-hour refresher session designed to revise your foundational C++ concepts so you are ready for this 10-week Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course.

You can [watch this hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3pzoPubz4) on youtube.

## Topics Covered
We will revise the following concepts:  
1. Variables and Data Types  
2. Input/Output Operations  
3. Operators  
4. Basic Program Structure  

### Concept 1: Variables and Data Types
Variables are like containers in a kitchen where you store ingredients — each has a name and holds a specific type of item.

In C++, variables store data, and **data types** define what kind of data they can hold (e.g `int` for whole numbers, `double` for decimals, `char` for single characters, `bool` for true/false, etc.). 

Declaring a variable tells the compiler to reserve space in memory. Always initialize variables to avoid unexpected values.

**Example Program: Basic Variable Declaration and Usage**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    double height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';
    bool isStudent = true;
    
    // Output the values to the console
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Initial: " << initial << endl;
    cout << "Is Student: " << (isStudent ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
```
Age: 25
Height: 5.9
Initial: A
Is Student: Yes
```

### Concept 2: Input/Output Operations
- In C++, we use `std::cin` for input from the keyboard and `std::cout` for output to the screen. 
- Always include `<iostream>` and use `std::` namespace or `using namespace std;` for simplicity. 
- Handle inputs carefully to avoid errors, like reading extra spaces.

**Example Program: Simple Input and Output**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int quantity;  
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    
    cout << "Enter quantity of apples: ";
    cin >> quantity;
    
    // Output the results
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You want " << quantity << " apples." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**
Enter your name: Alice
Enter quantity of apples: 5
Hello, Alice! You want 5 apples.

### Concept 3: Operators
Operators are like math tools in a calculator: 
- arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for remainder) 
- relational (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for comparisons)
- logical (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT) 
- and assignment (`=`) 

Be careful 
- with division (integer division truncates decimals) 
- and operator precedence (use parentheses for clarity).

**Example Program: Using Operators for a Simple Calculator**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;
    
    int sum = a + b;
    int diff = a - b;
    int prod = a * b;
    int quot = a / b;
    int rem = a % b;  // Modulus: remainder (1)
    
    bool isGreaterAndSumBig = (a > b) && (sum > 10);
    
    // Output results
    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference: " << diff << endl;
    cout << "Product: " << prod << endl;
    cout << "Quotient: " << quot << endl;
    cout << "Remainder: " << rem << endl;
    cout << "Is a > b and sum > 10? " << (isGreaterAndSumBig ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
Is a > b and sum > 10? Yes
```
This mimics calculating a restaurant bill with checks.

### Concept 4: Basic Program Structure
Every C++ program is like a story: it has a beginning (`#include` directives and `main()`), middle (code body), and end (`return 0;`). 

Use comments (`//` or `/* */`) for notes, like labels on kitchen shelves. Compile with `g++` and run the executable. Common errors: missing semicolons or unmatched braces.

**Example Program: Hello World with Structure**
```cpp
// This is a single-line comment: Program to greet the world

/* This is a multi-line comment:
   Author: Your Teacher
   Purpose: Demonstrate basic structure */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
```
Hello, World!
```
This is the "first recipe" every programmer learns.

### Additional Reading - What happens when you compile your C / C++ program.

The compilation process in C++ transforms human-readable source code into an executable program that a computer can run. 

This process typically involves four main stages: **preprocessing**, **compilation**, **assembly**, and **linking**. These stages are often handled by a compiler toolchain like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang, which orchestrates them automatically when you run a command like `g++ main.cpp -o output`.

The process starts with your C++ source files (e.g., `.cpp`) and may include header files (`.h`). If there are multiple source files, each is processed independently through the first three stages, producing object files, which are then combined in the linking stage. Note that errors can occur at any stage (e.g., syntax errors during compilation), halting the process with diagnostic messages.

[main.cpp] --> [Preprocessor](Cleans & Expands) --> [main.i](Expanded Code) --> [Compiler](Translates) --> [main.s](Assembly Code) --> [Assembler](Converts) --> [main.o](Object File) --> [Linker](Combines) --> [main.exe](Executable)
                      

### 1. Preprocessing
This is the first stage, handled by the preprocessor (e.g., `cpp` in GCC). It prepares the source code by resolving directives and macros before actual compilation.

**Input**: Your C++ source code (main.cpp), e.g., a file with #include <iostream> and your program logic.
**What Happens**: The preprocessor acts like an editor who:

- Replaces #include with the contents of header files (e.g., adds iostream code).
- Expands macros (e.g., #define PI 3.14 becomes 3.14 everywhere).
- Removes comments and handles directives like #ifdef.

**Output**: A single, expanded text file (main.i) with all headers included and macros resolved.

e.g. 
```text
main.cpp:                       main.i:
#include <iostream>            [Contents of iostream]
#define MAX 100                int main() {
int main() {                     std::cout << 100;
  std::cout << MAX;            }
}
```

### Compilation: Translating to a Printer’s Language

Input: The preprocessed file (main.i).
What Happens: The compiler reads the expanded code and translates it into assembly language (a low-level code closer to what the computer understands). It:

Checks for errors (e.g., missing semicolons).
Converts C++ constructs (loops, functions) into instructions for the CPU.


Output: An assembly file (main.s) with CPU-specific instructions like mov or add.

e.g.
```text
main.s:
mov rax, 1         ; Example assembly instructions
call _ZSt4cout     ; Calls to output "100"
```

### 3. Assembly: Converting to Machine Code

Input: The assembly file (main.s).
What Happens: The assembler converts the assembly instructions into binary machine code that the computer’s CPU can directly execute. It:

Turns text instructions into 0s and 1s.
Prepares data like variables for memory.


Output: An object file (main.o), a binary file with machine code but not yet runnable.
e.g.
```text
main.o:
[Binary: 01001010 11001100 ...]
```

### 4. Linking: Binding the Book

Input: One or more object files (main.o, others if you have multiple .cpp files) and libraries.
What Happens: The linker combines all pieces:

Connects your code to library functions (e.g., std::cout from libstdc++).
Resolves references (e.g., where is cout defined?).
Arranges the code in memory so it can run.


Output: A final executable file (main.exe or a.out), ready to run on your computer.
e.g. 
```text
main.exe:
[Runnable program: Run it with ./main.exe]
```

### Key Points

***Errors***: If there’s a mistake (e.g., typo in code), the process stops at the stage where the error is found, showing a message (e.g., “missing semicolon”).
***Tools***: A compiler like g++ automates all steps with one command: g++ main.cpp -o main.
***Multiple Files***: If your program has multiple .cpp files, each goes through steps 1–3, then all .o files are linked in step 4.

### Points to Remember for Interview Preparation
- Understand data type sizes (e.g., `int` is usually 4 bytes) and ranges to avoid overflow in interviews (e.g., use `long long` for large numbers).  
- Know the difference between signed and unsigned types for edge cases in problems.  
- Master operator precedence and associativity—interviews often test tricky expressions like `a + b * c`.  
- Use `std::endl` vs `\n` for output: `endl` flushes the buffer, which can be slower in performance-critical code.  
- Always handle input validation; `cin` can fail — use `cin.fail()` in robust code for interviews.  
- Remember `#include` guards and namespaces to avoid conflicts in larger programs.  
- In interviews, explain why you choose a data type (e.g., `float` vs `double` for precision).  
- Practice writing clean, commented code—interviewers value readability.  
- Know common pitfalls: uninitialized variables lead to undefined behavior.
