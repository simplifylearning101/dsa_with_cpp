## Solutions for the Quiz
1. 0  
2. int arr[10];  
3. Undefined behavior (crash or wrong data).  
4. int arr[5] = {};  
5. O(1)  
6. sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0])  
7. False (raw arrays can't).  
8. Pointer to first element.  
9. for(int i=0; i<size; i++) cout << arr[i];  
10. Remaining elements default to 0.  
11. Array becomes pointer when passed to function.  
12. Because size is lost due to decay.  
13. Array fixed, vector dynamic.  
14. Garbage values.  
15. temp = arr[i]; arr[i] = arr[j]; arr[j] = temp;  
16. Elements stored next to each other.  
17. int max = arr[0]; for(i=1; i<n; i++) if(arr[i]>max) max=arr[i];  
18. Loop to copy element by element.  
19. True.  
20. e.g., Finding duplicates in list.  
21. Variable storing memory address.  
22. Makes variable read-only.  
23. & address-of, * dereference.  
24. Alias to another variable.  
25. Include headers for declarations.  
26. #include <vector>; vector<int> v;  
27. Associative container for key-value.  
28. Adds element to end.  
29. Set unique, multiset allows duplicates.  
30. std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());
