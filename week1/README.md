# Week 1 Roadmap: Mastering C++ STL for DSA Preparation

This roadmap outlines a 10-hour plan for Week 1, designed to help students master the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each hour focuses on specific STL components, using real-world analogies and fully commented programs to simplify concepts. The final hours include interview practice and a mini-project to consolidate learning. The plan assumes no prior knowledge and emphasizes hands-on practice with homework and LeetCode/NeetCode problems.
