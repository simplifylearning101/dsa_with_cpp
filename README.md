# 10-Week DSA Cohort Roadmap in C++

Welcome to the 10-Week DSA Mastery Cohort! We'll focus on building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++, tailored for your first step in coding interviews. 

### Overview of this program:

- Goal: Master DSA in C++ for coding interviews.
- Approach: Start with C++ revision (Week 0), master STL (Week 1), then build DSA expertise (Weeks 2–9), and integrate skills with mock interviews (Week 10).
- Methodology: Concepts explained with real-world analogies, fully commented C++ code, daily homework (10–15 programs), LeetCode/NeetCode practice, and weekly projects.
- Tools: C++11/14, LeetCode (tag by topic), NeetCode (curated roadmaps). Track progress in a problem-solving journal.

This is a cohort based model of learning. Students will join the cohort and learn together. There would be lectures 2-3 hours per week covering conceptual explanations with real-world examples and C++ programs.
Students are then expected to practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed. We will slowly start introducing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.

Weekly fun project: A mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). You will form a group, work on project and present it to rest of the cohort members.

## Before we start
1. Do you have a local environement run Cpp programs? If not, reachout to tech coodinator for help (details below)  
2. Are you familiar with git and github? If not, reachout to tech coodinator for help.
3. Create a github repo so that you can showcase your work, dedication and commitment. 

## Coordinators
Once you join the cohort, you will be invited to cohort WhatsApp group where you can seek help from our coordinators
