16. Explain operator precedence in `a + b * c`.  
17. Write an `if` statement to check if a number is positive.

23. Write a function to check if a number is odd.  
24. What is the size of `double` typically?  
25. How to initialize an array with zeros?  
26. What is the output of `for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) cout << i;`?  
27. Explain logical OR with an example.  
28. Write a program to reverse a 3-element array.  
29. What happens if a function doesnâ€™t return a value when expected?  
30. Why use functions in coding interviews?

## Quiz Solutions
1. A reusable block of code performing a specific task.  
2. Allows function declaration before definition.  
3. Sends a value back to the caller and exits function.  
4. `int doubleNum(int n) { return n * 2; }`  
5. Local to the function/block.  
6. Variable declared outside functions, accessible everywhere.  
7. Use `::variableName` to access global.  
8. A fixed-size collection of same-type elements.  
9. 0  
10. `for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) cout << arr[i];`  
11. Undefined behavior, likely crash.  
12. `int sum(int a, int b) { return a + b; }`  
13. Duration a variable exists in memory.  
14. `float arr[5];`  
15. 2  
16. `*` before `+`, so `b * c` first.  
17. `if (num > 0) cout << "Positive";`  
18. Includes I/O library.  
19. `int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) sum += arr[i];`  
20. Local is limited to block/function; global is program-wide.  
21. Use unique variable names or `::` for global.  
22. Exits the loop immediately.  
23. `bool isOdd(int n) { return n % 2 != 0; }`  
24. 8 bytes typically.  
25. `int arr[5] = {0};`  
26. 012  
27. `true || false = true`, e.g., `age < 18 || height < 5.5`.  
28. `int arr[3]; for (int i = 0; i < 3/2; i++) { int t = arr[i]; arr[i] = arr[2-i]; arr[2-i] = t; }`  
29. Undefined behavior or compiler error if return type expected.  
30. Shows modularity, readability, and problem-solving skills.
