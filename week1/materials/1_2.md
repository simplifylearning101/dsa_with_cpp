# Hour 1 Homework: Vector Practice Problems

Below are 10 practice problems to reinforce understanding of C++ STL vectors. Each problem includes a description, expected outcome, and example to guide students. These problems range from basic to slightly complex to build confidence for coding interviews.

1. **Problem**: Create a vector to store 5 integers input by the user and print them in reverse order.  
   **Outcome**: Understand vector initialization and reverse iteration.  
   **Example**: Input: 1 2 3 4 5 → Output: 5 4 3 2 1  

2. **Problem**: Write a program to add 10 even numbers (2, 4, ..., 20) to a vector and print its size and capacity.  
   **Outcome**: Practice `push_back`, `size`, and `capacity`.  
   **Example**: Output: Size: 10, Capacity: >=10 (e.g., 16)  

3. **Problem**: Remove the last element from a vector of strings and print the updated vector.  
   **Outcome**: Master `pop_back` and vector traversal.  
   **Example**: Input: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] → Output: ["apple", "banana"]  

4. **Problem**: Create a vector of 5 integers and double each element using a loop.  
   **Outcome**: Learn to modify vector elements.  
   **Example**: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  

5. **Problem**: Check if a vector of integers is empty. If not, print its first and last elements.  
   **Outcome**: Understand `empty`, `front`, and `back`.  
   **Example**: Input: [10, 20, 30] → Output: First: 10, Last: 30  

6. **Problem**: Resize a vector to hold exactly 3 elements, filling new elements with 0 if needed.  
   **Outcome**: Practice `resize` and its behavior.  
   **Example**: Input: [1, 2] → Output: [1, 2, 0]  

7. **Problem**: Create a 2D vector (3x3) and initialize it with values 1 to 9. Print it as a matrix.  
   **Outcome**: Understand vector of vectors.  
   **Example**: Output:  
   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

8. **Problem**: Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a vector using iterators.  
   **Outcome**: Practice iterator-based traversal.  
   **Example**: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: Sum: 10  

9. **Problem**: Copy elements from one vector to another and print the new vector in reverse.  
   **Outcome**: Learn vector copying and reverse iteration.  
   **Example**: Input: [1, 2, 3] → Output: [3, 2, 1]  

10. **Problem**: Reserve space for 100 elements in a vector, add 5 elements, and print size and capacity.  
    **Outcome**: Understand `reserve` and its impact on capacity.  
    **Example**: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → Output: Size: 5, Capacity: 100
