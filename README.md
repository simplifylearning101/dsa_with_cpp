# 10-Week DSA Cohort Roadmap in C++

Welcome to the 10-Week DSA Mastery Cohort! We'll focus on building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++, tailored for your first step in coding interviews. 

### Overview of this program:

Goal: Master DSA in C++ for coding interviews.
Approach: Start with C++ revision (Week 0), master STL (Week 1), then build DSA expertise (Weeks 2–9), and integrate skills with mock interviews (Week 10).
Methodology: Concepts explained with real-world analogies, fully commented C++ code, daily homework (10–15 programs), LeetCode/NeetCode practice, and weekly projects.
Tools: C++11/14, LeetCode (tag by topic), NeetCode (curated roadmaps). Track progress in a problem-solving journal.

This is a cohort based model of learning. Students will join the cohort and learn together. There would be lectures 2-3 hours per week covering conceptual explanations with real-world examples and C++ programs.
Students are then expected to practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed. We will slowly start introducing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.

Weekly fun project: A mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). You will form a group, work on project and present it to rest of the cohort members.

## Prerequisite
1. You need to have a local environement setup to run Cpp programs.  
2. You should have familarity with git and have a repo in github.
