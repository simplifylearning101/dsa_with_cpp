### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a Student Database Management System as a console-based application in C++. The system should manage student records, allowing users to add, display, and search for students based on their IDs. Each student record includes their ID, name, and average grade. The application should demonstrate core C++ concepts like classes, functions, pointers, and loops, making it an ideal project for students refreshing their fundamentals.

Real-World Analogy: Think of the system as a librarian managing a catalog of student records in a notebook (array). You can add new entries, list all entries, or find a specific student by their ID number.

### Requirements

### Functionality:
- Add Student: Allow users to input a student’s ID, name, and average grade, storing the record in an array of student objects.
- Display All Students: Show all stored student records with their details in a formatted manner.
- Search by ID: Find and display a student’s details using their unique ID.
Exit: Allow the user to quit the program.


### Constraints:
- Store up to 100 students (fixed-size array).
- Student ID must be a positive integer and unique.
- Average grade is a float between 0.0 and 100.0.
- Name is a string (max 50 characters).


### C++ Concepts Used:
- Classes/Objects: Define a Student class to encapsulate ID, name, and grade.
- Functions: Implement functions for adding, displaying, and searching students.
- Pointers/References: Use references for passing student objects to functions.
- Loops/Conditionals: Handle menu navigation and input validation.
- Arrays: Store student objects in a fixed-size array.
- Input/Output: Use cin/cout for user interaction.


### User Interface:
Console-based menu to choose options (Add, Display, Search, Exit).
Clear prompts and error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., duplicate ID, invalid grade).


### Expected Output:
- Adding a student: Confirm addition with student details.
- Displaying all: List all students in a table-like format (ID, Name, Grade).
- Searching: Show student details if found, or "Not found" if ID doesn’t exist.


### Deliverable: 
A single C++ file with commented code, implementing all functionality, ready to compile and run.
