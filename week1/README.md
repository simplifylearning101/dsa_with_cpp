# Week 1 Roadmap: Mastering C++ STL for DSA Preparation

This roadmap outlines a 10-hour plan for Week 1, designed to help students master the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each hour focuses on specific STL components, using real-world analogies and fully commented programs to simplify concepts. The final hours include interview practice and a mini-project to consolidate learning. The plan assumes no prior knowledge and emphasizes hands-on practice with homework and LeetCode/NeetCode problems.

| Hour | Topic | Key Concepts Covered | Teaching Approach | Homework/Practice |
|------|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Introduction to C++ STL and Vectors | - What is STL? Components: Containers, Algorithms, Iterators, Functors.<br>- Real-world analogy: STL as a toolbox for building efficient programs, like a kitchen with pre-made utensils.<br>- Vectors: Dynamic arrays, declaration, initialization, common operations (push_back, pop_back, size, capacity, resize, reserve).<br>- Access elements: at(), operator[], front(), back().<br>- Iterators for vectors. | - Explain concepts with real-world examples (e.g., vector as a shopping list that grows dynamically).<br>- Demonstrate with 2-3 fully commented C++ programs showing basic usage, insertion, deletion, and iteration.<br>- Interactive Q&A to ensure understanding. | - 10 programs: Basic vector operations, vector of vectors (2D), sorting vectors manually vs. STL sort (intro).<br>- Practice 5 easy LeetCode problems involving arrays/vectors (e.g., Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array). |
| 2 | Arrays and Deques in STL | - Arrays: Fixed-size, declaration, initialization, advantages over C-style arrays.<br>- Deques: Double-ended queues, operations (push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back).<br>- Comparison with vectors: When to use deques (e.g., for queues needing front insertions).<br>- Real-world: Deque as a conveyor belt allowing addition/removal from both ends. | - Use examples like managing a playlist (deque for adding songs front/back).<br>- 2-3 commented programs: Array usage in fixed data, deque for simulating queues/stacks.<br>- Discuss time complexities simply. | - 12 programs: Array manipulations, deque as stack/queue, converting vector to deque.<br>- NeetCode/LeetCode: 5 problems on sliding windows or queues (e.g., Sliding Window Maximum). |
| 3 | Lists and Forward Lists | - Lists: Doubly-linked lists, operations (insert, erase, splice, merge).<br>- Forward Lists: Singly-linked lists, efficient insertions/deletions at beginning.<br>- Pros/cons vs. vectors (no random access in lists).<br>- Real-world: List as a chain of people holding hands, easy to insert/remove in middle. | - Examples: Undo-redo stack (list for efficient splices).<br>- Commented programs: Building a list, inserting in sorted order, merging two lists.<br>- Emphasize no indexing in lists. | - 10 programs: List traversals, removing duplicates from list, forward list for FIFO.<br>- LeetCode: 6 problems on linked lists (e.g., Reverse Linked List, though STL list isn't exactly like manual nodes). |
| 4 | Sets and Multisets | - Sets: Ordered unique elements, based on red-black trees, operations (insert, erase, find, count).<br>- Multisets: Allow duplicates, similar operations.<br>- Real-world: Set as a unique collection of stamps, multiset as inventory with multiples.<br>- Custom comparators. | - Example: Managing unique user IDs (set), or scores allowing ties (multiset).<br>- Programs: Inserting into set, finding elements, erasing ranges.<br>- Commented code for union/intersection using sets. | - 11 programs: Set operations, multiset for frequency counting, custom comparator sets.<br>- LeetCode: 5 problems on unique elements (e.g., Contains Duplicate). |
| 5 | Maps and Multimaps | - Maps: Ordered key-value pairs, unique keys, operations (insert, erase, find, [] operator).<br>- Multimaps: Allow duplicate keys.<br>- Real-world: Map as a dictionary (word to meaning), multimap as phonebook with multiple numbers per name.<br>- Iterating over maps. | - Examples: Student grades (map: name to grade), contacts (multimap: name to phones).<br>- Commented programs: Building a map, updating values, erasing by key.<br>- Discuss logarithmic time complexities. | - 12 programs: Map as frequency counter, multimap for grouping, inverting a map.<br>- LeetCode: 6 problems on hash maps (e.g., Two Sum, though maps are ordered). |
| 6 | Unordered Sets and Unordered Maps | - Unordered Sets: Hash-based, unique elements, faster average-case operations.<br>- Unordered Maps: Hash-based key-value, unique keys.<br>- Custom hash functions if needed.<br>- Real-world: Unordered set as a quick lookup for membership, like a guest list check.<br>- Comparison with ordered versions (average O(1) vs. O(log n)). | - Examples: Fast duplicate check (unordered set), caching (unordered map).<br>- Programs: Insert/find in unordered set/map, handling collisions implicitly.<br>- Commented code showing performance differences in large data. | - 10 programs: Unordered set for uniqueness, unordered map for anagrams, custom hash examples.<br>- LeetCode: 7 problems on hashing (e.g., Valid Anagram). |
| 7 | STL Algorithms | - Non-modifying: find, count, all_of, any_of, none_of.<br>- Modifying: copy, move, transform, replace.<br>- Sorting: sort, stable_sort, partial_sort.<br>- Binary search: lower_bound, upper_bound.<br>- Heap operations: make_heap, push_heap.<br>- Real-world: Algorithms as recipes applied to containers, e.g., sorting a deck of cards. | - Examples: Searching in a phonebook (find), transforming grades (transform).<br>- Multiple commented programs: Sorting vectors, binary search on sets, using lambdas with algorithms.<br>- Emphasize generic nature across containers. | - 13 programs: Implementing min/max with algorithms, merging sorted containers, partition algorithms.<br>- LeetCode: 5 problems using STL algos (e.g., Sort Colors). |
| 8 | Iterators, Functors, and Advanced STL | - Iterators: Types (input, output, forward, bidirectional, random access), begin/end, advance, distance.<br>- Functors: Function objects, lambdas, bind.<br>- Other: Pairs, tuples, priority_queue, stack, queue.<br>- Real-world: Iterators as pointers navigating a map, functors as customizable tools.<br>- Adapters: Stack/queue from deque. | - Examples: Using priority_queue for task scheduling.<br>- Commented programs: Custom functors, iterating with different types, tuple unpacking.<br>- Tie together previous concepts. | - 11 programs: Priority queue for top K, stack/queue simulations, lambda with algorithms.<br>- LeetCode: 6 problems on heaps/queues (e.g., Kth Largest Element). |
| 9 | Interview Questions on C++ STL | - Common questions: Differences between vector/list, map/unordered_map, when to use each.<br>- Time complexities of operations.<br>- Coding problems: Implement using STL (e.g., LRU Cache with map/list, frequency count).<br>- Behavioral: Debugging STL code, best practices. | - Review key concepts from hours 1-8.<br>- Solve 5-7 live coding questions with explanations and comments.<br>- Discuss pitfalls (e.g., invalidating iterators).<br>- Group discussions on solutions. | - Solve 10-15 LeetCode medium problems using STL (e.g., Group Anagrams, Top K Frequent Elements).<br>- Review NeetCode STL-related sections. |
