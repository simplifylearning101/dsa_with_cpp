# 10-Week DSA Cohort Roadmap in C++

Welcome to the 10-Week DSA Mastery Cohort! We'll focus on building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++, tailored for coding interviews. 

### Overview of this program:

Goal: Master DSA in C++ for coding interviews.
Approach: Start with C++ revision (Week 0), master STL (Week 1), then build DSA expertise (Weeks 2–9), and integrate skills with mock interviews (Week 10).
Methodology: Concepts explained with real-world analogies, fully commented C++ code, daily homework (10–15 programs), LeetCode/NeetCode practice, and weekly projects.
Tools: C++11/14, LeetCode (tag by topic), NeetCode (curated roadmaps). Track progress in a problem-solving journal.

This is a cohort based model of learning. Students will join the cohort and learn together. There would be lectures 2-3 hours per week covering conceptual explanations with real-world examples and C++ programs.
Students are then expected to practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed. We will slowly start introducing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.

Weekly fun project: A mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). You will form a group, work on project and present it to rest of the cohort members.

## Prerequisite
1. You need to have a local environement setup to run Cpp programs.  
2. You should have familarity with git and have a repo in github.



## Roadmap
### Week 0: Theme - Revising C++ Fundamentals 

You will be referring week0 folder for this week.

Start with [Cpp Refresher](https://github.com/simplifylearning101/dsa_with_cpp/blob/main/week0/1_cpp_refresher.md)

Then do a deep dive:
1. pointers
2. classes and objects

Complete the homework - refer the homework file.

Try simple leetcode problems - refer leetcode file. 

Work on a project. See project ideas.

Outcome Expected: Students refresh core C++ concepts from college, writing basic programs confidently, understanding pointers, references, and basic OOP principles, preparing for STL and DSA. 

By the end of the week, you will be comfortable writing some advanced C++ programs, manipulating arrays, woking with pointers, using classes and objects. You'll start thinking about time/space complexity basics and introduced to Big-O operations confidently.
