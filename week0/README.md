### Week 0: Theme - [Revising C++ Fundamentals]

Start with [Cpp Refresher](https://github.com/simplifylearning101/dsa_with_cpp/blob/main/week0/1_cpp_refresher.md)

Then do a deep dive:
1. pointers
2. classes and objects

Complete the homework - refer the homework file.

Try simple leetcode problems - refer leetcode file. 

Work on a project. See project ideas.

Outcome Expected: Students refresh core C++ concepts from college, writing basic programs confidently, understanding pointers, references, and basic OOP principles, preparing for STL and DSA. 

By the end of the week, you will be comfortable writing some advanced C++ programs, manipulating arrays, woking with pointers, using classes and objects. You'll start thinking about time/space complexity basics and introduced to Big-O operations confidently.
