# 10-Week DSA Cohort Roadmap in C++

Welcome to the 10-Week DSA Mastery Cohort! We'll focus on building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++, tailored for coding interviews. 

### Overview of this program:

Goal: Master DSA in C++ for coding interviews.
Approach: Start with C++ revision (Week 0), master STL (Week 1), then build DSA expertise (Weeks 2–9), and integrate skills with mock interviews (Week 10).
Methodology: Concepts explained with real-world analogies, fully commented C++ code, daily homework (10–15 programs), LeetCode/NeetCode practice, and weekly projects.
Tools: C++11/14, LeetCode (tag by topic), NeetCode (curated roadmaps). Track progress in a problem-solving journal.

This is a cohort based model of learning. Students will join the cohort and learn together. There would be lectures 2-3 hours per week covering conceptual explanations with real-world examples and C++ programs.
Students are then expected to practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed. We will slowly start introducing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.

Weekly fun project: A mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). You will form a group, work on project and present it to rest of the cohort members.

## Prerequisite
1. You need to have a local environement setup to run Cpp programs.  
2. You should have familarity with git and have a repo in github.



## Roadmap
### Week 0: Theme - Revising C++ Fundamentals via our [Cpp Refresher](https://github.com/simplifylearning101/cpp_refresher/blob/main/materials/1_cpp_refresher.md)


Outcome Expected: Students refresh core C++ concepts from college, writing basic programs confidently, understanding pointers, references, and basic OOP principles, preparing for STL and DSA.

Topics Covered:
1. Basics: Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions.
2. Pointers and References: Memory addresses, dereferencing.
3. OOP Basics: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.


Outcome Expected: By the end of the week, you will be comfortable writing some advanced C++ programs, manipulating arrays, woking with pointers, using classes and objects. You'll start thinking about time/space complexity basics and introduced to Big-O operations confidently.

Homework: 10-12 programs (e.g., reverse array, find max/min, rotate array). Also aim to solve 20 LeetCode easy array problems (e.g., #1 Two Sum, #26 Remove Duplicates).

Project: Build a simple console app e.g. "Inventory Manager" – Use vectors to store items (name, quantity); implement add/remove/search functions. Showcase your achievement.
